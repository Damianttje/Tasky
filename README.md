## What's Tasky all about?

Tasky is your go-to task manager that lets you:
- Add tasks to your list
- Check off completed tasks
- Drag and drop to reorder your priorities
- Delete tasks you don't need anymore

And guess what? It's got a dark theme to keep your eyes happy! üòé

## Tech Stuff

Tasky is built with some cool tech:
- **PHP** (for the behind-the-scenes magic)
- **SQLite** (to keep your tasks safe and sound)
- **HTML, CSS** (Tailwind and DaisyUI for that slick look)
- A sprinkle of **JavaScript** (with HTMX for smooth interactions)

## Getting Started

Before you dive in, make sure you've got:
- **PHP** 8.1 or newer
- A web server like Apache or Nginx
- Composer (optional, but handy for managing dependencies)

Ready to roll? Here's how to get Tasky up and running:

1. Grab the code (clone or download, your choice)
2. Check if PHP is ready to go (`php -v` in your terminal)
3. Point your web server to the `public` folder
4. Fire up your browser and you're all set!

## Using Tasky

1. Sign up for an account (don't sweat, it's quick and painless)
2. Start adding those tasks that have been floating around in your head
3. Check 'em off as you conquer your day
4. Drag tasks around when priorities shift (because they always do)
5. Delete tasks when you're done (or when you realize they weren't that important after all)

## What's Next?

We've got some exciting stuff cooking to make Tasky even cooler:

1. **Project Power-Up**: Separate to-do lists for different projects, because mixing work and play is so last year
2. **Category Cool**: Sort your tasks into categories, perfect for when you're in the mood for specific types of productivity
3. **Share the Load**: Team up with friends or colleagues by sharing your lists (misery loves company, right?)
4. **Zen Mode**: A sleek, minimalist view that updates in real-time, for when you need to get in the zone
5. **UI Upgrade**: We're working on making Tasky even prettier (if that's even possible)
6. **API Awesomeness**: For you tech wizards out there, integrate Tasky with all your other fancy tools

Stay tuned for these awesome updates! üöÄ
