Tasky is a straightforward task manager that lets you:
- Add tasks to your list

- Drag and drop to reorder your tasks
- Delete tasks you don't need anymore

Plus, it's got a dark theme to keep your eyes happy! 😎

## Tech Stuff

Tasky is built with:
- **PHP** (the behind-the-scenes magic)
- **SQLite** (for storing your tasks)
